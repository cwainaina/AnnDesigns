                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        The chef's coat is a double-breasted white jacket typically made of two layers of thick
                         <em> cotton</em> It is fairly common in finer restaurants to
                          see all kitchen staff wearing a similar uniform: the chef's coat, black and white checked pants, and a chef hat..
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The double layering of the chef's coat helps provides resistance to heat. Buttons may either be made of 
                        plastic or cotton. The reason behind the cotton buttons is quite simple. They tend to withstand the
                         frequent washings of the coat better than plastic buttons.
                    </p>

                        <blockquote>
                            Since cooking is a messy business, the double-breasted style of the chef's coat serves an important purpose
                        </blockquote>

                    <p><small>This fabric makes the chef's coat more breathable and thus more comfortable. As well,
                         the white color can be bleached to wash out difficult stains and to keep the chef's coat looking perfectly white.</small></p>

                    <h2>Why we need this Coat</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            it can do a fine job making sure that your sleeve doesn’t catch on fire or that the steam
                             hits your jacket instead of your skin.
                        </li>
                        <li> The thick fabric can prevent a sharp tool from tearing the jacket and your skin, and it 
                            can prevent boiling hot liquids from giving you serious burns.
                        </li>
                        <li>if you spill something on yourself, but find that you need to leave the kitchen, you can simply 
                            unbutton the coat and switch the stained layer with the fresh, clean layer. The thick fabric ensures
                             that the bottom layer is stain free, so no one has to know that you’ve got marinara or gravy stains on your
                             jacket. If you don’t do a lot of messy cooking, single breasted jackets are also available.
                        </li>
                        <li> It also signals that the wearer is a professional that takes his career seriously.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    
                    <h3><u id="ChoseJacket"> Choosing the Right Chef’s Jacket</u></h3>
                    <p>Now that you know why you need a chef’s jacket, how are you supposed to know which one you need?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Buy the highest quality jacket you can afford. Like every product available these days, you can buy a cheap,
                             inferior chef’s jacket, but it will look cheap, and probably won’t perform the most important duty of
                              keeping you safe. In addition, jackets and other uniform pieces
                             made of inferior materials are often itchy and uncomfortable, which can be distracting when you’re
                              trying to get dinner service going.</li>
                        <li>Buy a jacket that fits. While you may think it’s more comfortable to buy a bigger jacket, loose fabric 
                            and sleeves that are too long are asking for accidents. Also, an ill fitting jacket just doesn’t
                             look as professional. If you’re a woman, make sure to buy a jacket that is designed for a woman 
                             for the best fit.</li>
                        <li>Care for your jacket properly. This means treating stains right away if possibler</li>
                        <li> Even though you may be tired after a long shift, take your jacket off and hang it up 
                            to prevent wrinkles. Wash your jacket only as necessary to prolong the fabric</li>
                        <li>consider embroidering your restaurant logo on your jacket if you’re sure you’re not
                             going anywhere anytime soon, or you are the owner of the restaurant.</li>
                        <li>Buy an extra jacket if funds allow. Your jacket will get spilled on, pulled, and maybe even burned. 
                            Having an extra jacket on hand allows you to seamlessly continue working with a simple switch of coats</li>
